830,39,Short mumu,"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

- runs large, which is the style of the top anyhow. however, i was swimming in the medium (and i normally fit in size 10/12 or m/l tops with retailer stuff. you can easily size down and have plenty of room left. but if you like it really baggy, then stick with your normal size. for reference, i'm a 36c and hourglass and had ample room in a medium.
